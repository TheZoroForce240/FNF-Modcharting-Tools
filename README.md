# FNF Modcharting Tools
Just a thing I made to make modcharting easier, should be easy to add to most engines.
Still very WIP and not everything is supported yet!

## Features
### Modifier system for easing in and out effects

### Custom Sustain Renderer (using FlxStrip for stretchy sustains)
### Multiple playfields that can have their own positions and modifiers

### Custom Modifier Support via Hscript

### Support for multiple engines
- Base Game (not tested)
- [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine) (working 0.6.3, includes lua functions)
- [Leather Engine](https://github.com/Leather128/LeatherEngine) (working 0.5.0)
- [Kade Engine](https://github.com/KadeDev/Kade-Engine) (not tested)
- [Yoshi Engine](https://github.com/YoshiCrafter29/YoshiCrafterEngine) (not tested)
- [Forever Engine Legacy](https://github.com/Yoshubs/Forever-Engine-Legacy) (not tested)
- [FPS Plus](https://github.com/ThatRozebudDude/FPS-Plus-Public) (not tested)


## Credits 
- [Original FNF Team](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin) - they made the game
- [NotITG](https://www.noti.tg/) - Inspiration (made me love modcharts lol)
- [OpenITG](https://github.com/openitg/openitg) - Math used for some modifiers

## Installation 
You need the most recent version of HaxeFlixel for it to work. (5.2.1 as of writing)
### With Source:
1. Install the haxelib by typing `haxelib git fnf-modcharting-tools https://github.com/TheZoroForce240/FNF-Modcharting-Tools` in the console
2. Now you only need to make a few small additions to get everything working,
- In MusicBeatState.hx:
```haxe

class MusicBeatState extends modcharting.ModchartMusicBeatState
{
  
```
- In PlayState.hx:
```haxe
import modcharting.ModchartFuncs;
import modcharting.NoteMovement;
import modcharting.PlayfieldRenderer;
  
```
```haxe

override public function create()
{

  //Add this before camfollow stuff and after strumLineNotes and notes have been made
  playfieldRenderer = new PlayfieldRenderer(strumLineNotes, notes, this);
  playfieldRenderer.cameras = [camHUD];
  add(playfieldRenderer);
  add(grpNoteSplashes); /*place splashes in front (add this if the engine has splashes).
  If you have added this: remove(or something) the add(grpNoteSplashes); which is by default below the add(strumLineNotes);*/
      
      
```

```haxe

// (at the bottom of create())

ModchartFuncs.loadLuaFunctions(); //add this if you want lua functions in scripts
//being used in psych engine as an example

callOnLuas('onCreatePost', []);
super.create();

```
```haxe

public function startCountdown():Void
{
  generateStaticArrows(0);
  generateStaticArrows(1);
  
  //add after generating strums
  NoteMovement.getDefaultStrumPos(this);

```

- In Note.hx:
```haxe

class Note extends FlxSprite
{
  //add these 2 variables for the renderer
  public var mesh:modcharting.SustainStrip = null;
  public var z:Float = 0;

```
- In Project.xml:
```xml
<!--Set this to the engine you're using!-->
<define name="PSYCH" />

<haxelib name="fnf-modcharting-tools" />

```
You need to define which engine you're using to fix compiling issues, or it would default to base game settings (downscroll won't work etc).
Available ones: PSYCH, KADE, LEATHER, FOREVER_LEGACY, YOSHI, FPSPLUS


3. Now if your game compiles successfully then you should be all good to go.
